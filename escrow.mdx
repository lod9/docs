title: CFX Asset Escrow
description: 'All of our scripts come with options to purchase "escrowed", what this means is that the source code is not open, but there is also an option to purchase unlocked.'
---

We are using new CFX protection system for our resources. That means you will find your resources after the payment on the keymaster website.

## Where?
You can find your resources on [keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net/asset-grants). Keep in mind it may take a minute to get added to your keymaster.

<Warning>
If you cannot find your resources, make sure you are signed into the same FiveM account you signed in with when purchasing the script off our site.
</Warning>


## Error: syntax error near ``'<\1>'``

There is 2 reasons this may be happening:


1. This error happens when you are using outdated server artifacts before CFX released there Escrow Asset Protection system.
- To fix it simply just upgrade to the latest server [artifacts](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/).

2. You are using filezilla which is breaking the structure of the script.
- To fix simply just use WinSCP or upload directly instead.
