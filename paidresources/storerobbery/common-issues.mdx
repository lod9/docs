## Issue #1: "Inventory too full"
Explanation:
This problem commonly occurs on QBCore servers and can also happen on ESX servers. It occurs when the paytype in the configuration is set to something like "markedbills," which indicates that a large item is being given as a reward. When the price is set to a high amount, the system tries to provide a significant amount of bigger bags or items as a result.

Solution:
Lower the reward count or change the item that is given.
