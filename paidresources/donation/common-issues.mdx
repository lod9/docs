## Issue #1: "Someone just claimed package X, but that package is not configured in the config"
Explanation:
When someone attempts to claim an unconfigured package through the command, the console will print "Someone just claimed package (PACKAGE NAME), but that package is not configured in the config". This message signifies that the script doesn't recognize the package because it hasn't been correctly set up in the script's configuration.

Solution:
Ensure that the package is properly configured in the script's config. (you can follow the configuration guide for a more detailed setup guide)
