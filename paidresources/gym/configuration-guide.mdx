config.api_key = 'secret_key_here' -- (type: string)
```

1 = QBCore
2 = Custom Framework
````

```lua Config.lua
config.framework = 0 -- (type: integer)
```

Print in console when a package is claimed (error prints will print regardless of this option)
```lua Config.lua
config.console_prints = true -- (type: boolean)
