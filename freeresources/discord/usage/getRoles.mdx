It returns a table containing all roles found on the user. **If the user is not in the discord, or there data could not be loaded, it will return false for all functions**.

```lua
exports.trase_discord:getRoles(serverId)
```
- serverId: ``integer``
    - The server ID of the player you want to retrieve the discord info for.

Returns: ``false`` or ``table``

## Examples
```lua
RegisterCommand('getRoles', function(src)
    local roles = exports.trase_discord:getRoles(src)

    if (not roles) then
        -- Player was not in the discord, no user found
        return
    end

    print(json.encode(roles, { indent = true }))
end)
```
