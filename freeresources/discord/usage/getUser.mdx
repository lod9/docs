It returns a table that contains Discord user data, including the user's name, discriminator, and avatar. **If the user is not in the discord, or there data could not be loaded, it will return false for all functions**.

```lua
exports.trase_discord:getUser(serverId)
```
- serverId: ``integer``
    - The server ID of the player you want to retrieve the discord info for.

Returns: ``false`` or ``table``

## Examples
```lua
RegisterCommand('getDiscordUser', function(src)
    local user = exports.trase_discord:getUser(src)

    if (not user) then
        -- Player was not in the discord, no user found
        return
    end

    print(json.encode(user, { indent = true }))
end)
