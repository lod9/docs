## Configuration Guide

<Warning>
Currently only supports ESX, QBCore will be available soon.
</Warning>

This is where you will configure the amount the each specific account is allowed to have. Currently the only accounts are: bank, money, black_money. The default cap is set to $5,000,000.
```lua
cfg.max = { -- (type: table)
    ['bank'] = 5000000, -- (type: integer)
    ['money'] = 5000000, -- (type: integer)
    ['black_money'] = 5000000 -- (type: integer)
}
```

The administration groups that will not be checked, and that are whitelisted to have as much money they wish. (The check uses the xPlayer.getGroup() so only support ESX groups) [Currently ESX Only supports 3 administrative groups. (user, mod, admin)]

```lua
cfg.whitelisted_groups = { 'admin' } -- (type: table)
```
##

<Tip>
Will always log to discord as long as the cfg.webhook is a valid webhook.
</Tip>

The flag is the option that will happen when the player is caught having the capped amount. 3 Types are allowed:
1. **Kick**
- Kicks & Wipes the players account money.
2. **Wipe**
- Only wipes the account that has the money.
3. **Log**
- Will only send a discord log and will not wipe or kick the player.

```lua
cfg.flag = 'kick' -- (type: string)
```

The amount of time (in seconds) that the script will check all the players for there money.
```lua
cfg.checkTime = 15 -- (type: integer)
```

A valid discord webhook where logs will be sent when a player has to much money in a specific account.
```lua
cfg.webhook = '' -- (type: string)
```
